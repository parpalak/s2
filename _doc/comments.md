## Comment System Overview

S2 includes a flexible and secure comment system designed to handle validation, spam detection, and moderation.

### Comment Submission Flow

1. **Request Handling**
   Incoming comments are sent to the `CommentController`. This controller performs initial validation of the comment content.

2. **Preview Mode**
   If the comment is submitted with the preview flag, it is formatted and returned without being stored or processed further.

3. **Spam Detection**
   If the comment is valid, it is passed to the `SpamDetectorInterface`. S2 includes a single implementation of this interface, which uses the Akismet service for spam detection.

   `SpamDetectorInterface` may return one of the following statuses:
    - `disabled`: The spam detection service is not enabled (API key not configured in the [control panel](https://github.com/parpalak/s2/wiki/Control-Panel#configuration)).
    - `failed`: An error occurred while calling the service.
    - `ham`: The comment is classified as not spam.
    - `spam`: The comment is considered spam.
    - `blatant`: The comment is blatant spam and can be safely ignored.

   If the comment is not marked as `ham`, an additional validation step checks for the presence of links
   in the comment text. If links are found, an error is returned.
   If no links are found and the comment is marked as `blatant`, another validation error about spam is returned.

4. **Moderation Logic**
   The engine supports optional manual moderation, controlled via the `S2_PREMODERATION` parameter,
   which can be enabled in the [control panel](https://github.com/parpalak/s2/wiki/Control-Panel#configuration).

   The moderation decision in `SpamDetectorReport::shouldGoToModeration()` is based on both
   the spam detection result and the moderation setting:

    - If the comment is `ham`, it is published immediately.
    - Comments classified as `spam` or `blatant` are never published directly.
    - If moderation is **enabled**, comments with spam check statuses `disabled` or `failed`
      are sent for manual review.

### Comment Publishing

If the decision is to publish the comment, the following actions are performed in `CommentController`:
- The comment is stored and visible on the page.
- Notification emails are sent to moderators and to users who subscribed to comment replies.
- The user is redirected to the commented page.

### Manual Moderation Flow

If the comment requires manual moderation:
- Notification emails are sent only to moderators whose email does not match the commenter's email.
- The user is redirected to a special controller `CommentSentController`.

The `CommentSentController` can access a special admin cookie (with the `_c` postfix),
which is set upon admin login.
If the logged-in adminâ€™s email matches the commenter's email,
the system assumes the comment was submitted by that moderator:

- The comment is published immediately.
- Subscribers are notified.
- The user is redirected to the post.

If the emails do not match:
- The comment is queued for review.
- Moderators can publish it later via the admin panel.
